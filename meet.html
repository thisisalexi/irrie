                <h3>My Story</h3>
                <p>This is me and i'm so excited to meet you.  I am a serial entrepreneur, doing many things that i am passionate about </p>
                <p>As a 
                    health coach, and one who sees health from holistic perspective, I'm ready to guide, facilitator, and hopefully someone with whom
                    you can journey the process of acheiving wellness. Life is really very simple and precious, yet we complicate it by not allowning
                    ourselves the time to grow and evolve into who we truly meant to be. I'm always evolving and i like that about me    </p>
                    <p>My openness to experience and expansion has been has been one the reasons why i enjoy witnessing the transformation of my clients. it's such a fulfilling 
                        feeling to honor our purpose and passion; which is the reason we were created in the first place.
                    </p>
                    <p>I believe that honoring that passion is key to living - and when you do, you will always find joy in your life's work</p>
